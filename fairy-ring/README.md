# Fairy-ring

Allows a teacher/adult to help children bring a fairy to life with the 
life giving magic of stories.

The adult presses the black buttons on the explorerhat and lights twinkle
 and the twinkly noises start to get louder. Pressing the brass ones when the story stops or gets boring.
 
Grimm really liked it but the fairy doll does not fit with the "Shop for Magical Creatures" mantra, they would like it to be more peek/view into the magical world or set up as a game with dolls.

## Success Criteria 
* Starts up automatically
* Shows a portal to the magical world as described at http://grimmandco.co.uk/ 
* The portal will fit in the library (possibly the fire place or a mirror)
* The controls will be simple to use by untrained adult
* As the UP control is triggered:
 * the lights get brighter (done)
 * the sound gets louder
 * the animation of the portal gets livelyer (representing the magical creatures being feed by stories and animations)
* When the DOWN control triggered the reverse happened
